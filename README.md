This software encodes a text file into a smaller size and decodes back to the original file. It uses Huffman's Encoding Algorithm - a lossless data compression algorithm. It reads frequent characters from input file and replaces them with shorter binary codeword. The original file can be produced again without losing any bit. The user interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is used for programming logic.
